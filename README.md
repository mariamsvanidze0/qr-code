# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Building the QR code component strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design. I used essential HTML tags for structure, linked external resources like stylesheets and favicons, and ensured compatibility with metadata. Media queries adjusted the layout for mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px), while Flexbox and CSS Grid centered content and spaced elements. I applied a CSS reset, used box-sizing: border-box, and imported the Google Font Outfit for consistent styling. This project helped me practice responsive design, clean layout management, and cohesive styling.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue refining my skills in responsive design, especially with complex layouts and advanced media queries. I'll focus on improving my proficiency with Flexbox and CSS Grid to create more dynamic and adaptable interfaces. Additionally, I aim to enhance my understanding of accessibility best practices and explore more advanced CSS features like animations and transitions for smoother user experiences.
